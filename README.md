# Mila

 &nbsp; The application posted here was developed to meet the challenge proposed in the<a href="https://www.hackathonsmiles.com.br/"> Smiles Hackathon </a>
  , to create a project that would make a loyalty program contribute to making travel dreams more accessible, inclusive and democratic.
  <br>
  &nbsp; Our group then worked with the idea of a travels social network, where it would be possible to organize the stages of travel planning, create groups with other tourists,
  and receive help from a chatbot, nicknamed Mila (which is also the name of the project itself), to book restaurants, flights, accommodation and pay for tour tickets.
     <br>
    &nbsp; In toral, we only had 72 hours to develop the project, and I believe the most challenging part of this endeavor was the race against time, which made uploading all the files in the final minutes even more exciting.<br>

   <br>
    &nbsp;
   For the short time we were given, we were instructed that we should send something that demonstrated the project's idea, instead of focusing on having all functionalities perfectly working. However, the code posted here will still be changed and polished to be more faithful to the beautiful design developed by my teammates affectionately listed below.
